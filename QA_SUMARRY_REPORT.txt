Complete list of filed bugs: See dev team repo for all open GitHub Issues tagged qa-week6

Total: 4

Multiple issues with switch statements unintentionally bleeding into one another due to the lack of a break; (FIXED) 

Code reference was causing player to gain enemyHP as markpoints due to incorrect variable assignment (FIXED) 

Calculate max enemies logic allowed for an extra enemy in contrast to the provided max because >= was used instead of > (FIXED) 

If you flee on the final boss, (and possibly other enemies?) They will simply dissapear. (NOT FIXED)

Conclusion
The game has 8 documented issues ranging from critical to cosmetic. With focused effort on critical bugs, the core gameplay loop is playable. Input validation and text speed are the areas needing most attention.

Total: 2
Bellow was taken directly from their KNOWN_ISSUES.md

Bug 1: Boss Room End State UI Not Rendering Severity: Critical Description: Upon completing the Boss Room encounter (either by eliminating the swarm or dying), the game state transitions to win or game_over, but the text overlays ("ALL ENTITIES ELIMINATED" or "CONSUMED BY THE SWARM") defined in BossRoom.draw do not appear. The player is left on the fight screen with no feedback. Repro Steps: 1. Launch the game and navigate to the Boss Room. 2. Defeat all 15 HerdMember enemies to trigger the win condition, OR allow player HP to drop to 0. 3. Observe that the specific victory/defeat text and background dimming do not render. Status: Fixed 

Bug 2: Botany Room Simulation Diagrams Invisible Severity: Major Description: The moving particle simulations ("diagrams") inside tanks A, B, and C in the Botany Room are not visible. While the sim_particles logic appears to update positions for bouncing, swarming, and circling behaviors, the pygame.draw.circle calls are not producing visible output on the tank surfaces, making the puzzle unsolvable. Repro Steps: Enter the Botany Room from the Hub. Inspect the three containment tanks (A, B, C). Attempt to identify the "Organized Intelligence" pattern. Note that the tanks appear empty despite the simulation code running. Status: Fixed

Conclusion
The game has 4 documented issues ranging from critical to cosmetic. With focused effort on critical bugs, the core gameplay loop is NOT playable. All individual puzzles need the most attention.
